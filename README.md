# Percolation
It checks whether the system (N by N matrix) percolates or not. 
This project has additional exercises: GreatCircle, PrimeCounter, Distance, Traspose, Rational and Harmonic. 
While the other three java programs are built to accomplish the goal of the project. 
To perform series of computational experiments, we create PercolationStats datatyope. 
Further, we build the Percolation data type using two ways - arrays and WeightedQuickUnionUF. The latter is a more optimized solution to the problem. 
I have attached a report which in detail explain what this program does. 
This project is adapted from the Princeton creative assignment website.
